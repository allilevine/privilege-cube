The Privilege Cube demonstrates the intersectionality and three-dimensionality of privilege in our society. There are six sides and six corresponding sliders that you can use to adjust each side's opacity to represent your privilege profile. Inspired by [Kojo Idrissa's talk at Alterconf Portland 2016](https://www.alterconf.com/talks/using-privilege-arbitrage-increase-inclusion).

Created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), [React Three Renderer](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer), and [React Range Slider](https://github.com/whoisandie/react-rangeslider).
